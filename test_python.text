Introduction:

In developing a comprehensive solution for historical data migration, the proposed idea revolves around creating a RESTful API endpoint. 
The primary objective is to facilitate the secure and efficient transfer of data from CSV files to a SQL database. To ensure flexibility, 
the API endpoint will be designed to operate with the HTTP POST method, accommodating the receipt of essential parameters for seamless integration.

Key Components:

REST Endpoint Design:

The foundational step involves crafting a REST endpoint compatible with the POST method. This approach is chosen for its ability to handle parameterized requests effectively.
Structured JSON Configuration:

Within the endpoint, a well-defined JSON structure is suggested to streamline the management of tables. Each table configuration within the JSON comprises essential fields, including:
table_name: Identifying the table in the SQL database.
path: Specifying the file path for the corresponding CSV data.
nrows: Defining the number of rows processed in each batch transaction.
Validation Mechanisms:

Emphasizing robustness, diverse validation mechanisms are recommended. These validations encompass checks for mandatory fields, path validity, and appropriate data types.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm:

An object-oriented programming approach is encouraged to enhance code organization and maintainability. By adhering to OOP principles, the implementation becomes modular and extensible.
Technological Stack:

The proposed solution advocates the utilization of Python, PySpark, and Flask libraries. PySpark facilitates efficient CSV data processing, while Flask streamlines the creation of the REST endpoint. This amalgamation ensures optimal performance and ease of implementation.
Usage Guidelines:

Prior to execution, ensure the installation of prerequisite Python packages, including Flask and PySpark.
Tailor the solution according to specific database connection details and preferred table-naming conventions.
Consider extending the determine_table_name function to align with unique file-naming conventions.
Considerations and Challenges:

While providing a robust foundation for historical data migration, users are urged to consider potential challenges, particularly in scenarios involving substantial datasets. Further optimization may be necessary based on specific use cases.
Implementation Instructions:

Execute the script and initiate POST requests to the designated endpoint, supplying the required parameters in the specified JSON format.
