The project consists, first, of a REST endpoint that allows the loading of information from different CSV files through the use of SQL and Pandas libraries. 
Additionally, validations have been added, such as checking whether the tables exist or if a specific number of rows or all rows are being inserted.
In the second part of the test, the SQL processing is done through Pandas in a Jupyter notebook for clarity in the processing and 
to demonstrate the data transformation steps in a clearer manner
